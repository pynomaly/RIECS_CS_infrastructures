Loss of the night,Pocket Science Citizen Science apps,com.cosalux.welovestars,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cosalux.welovestars&hl=en&gl=us,"""Contribute to a world-wide citizen science project."" (The Guardian)
""Find out exactly how bad the light pollution is."" (Chandra Clarke, citizensciencecenter.com)
""The app couldn't be easier to use, and you can even learn different constellations along the way."" (Nicholas Fordes, plos.org)

The Loss of the Night app turns your eyes into a light meter, allowing you to become a citizen scientist and report how bright the night sky is where you live!

In many parts of the world, the night sky shines with wasted artificial light from poorly designed street lamps. Skyglow outshines the stars in the skies, and dramatically changes the natural nighttime environment. Scientists are concerned that light pollution might have a big impact on nocturnal ecosystems, but they have very little information about how bright the actually sky is worldwide, or how skyglow is changing over the years.

You can help monitor skyglow using this app! It's based on Google's Sky Map, and lets you make measurements with a very sensitive, stable, and well understood light meter: your eyes! All you need to do is look for certain stars in the sky, and tell us whether you can see them or not. Using the Loss of the Night app is both fun and educational, and it also generates important scientific information that might help to protect the environment in the future.

After you've finished your measurement, your data will be anonymously sent to the GLOBE at Night project. You can see it on a map, check how accurate your measurment was, track changes over time, and compare it to other observations from around the world at http://www.myskyatnight.com.

Counting stars is a great experience and family activity, and you might find that you learn the names of stars and constellations without even trying. Students can use the app to measure skyglow and star visibility for their own science projects, and at the same time be part of a global citizen science network. The most important information for this project comes from brightly lit places where you can't see many stars, but you're welcome to use it in places where you can still see the Milky Way. If you’re lucky enough to be in such a place, let others know!

Satellites look at the ground, not the sky. By comparing the skyglow to the ground brightness, you will help communities learn what types of lamps light the streets instead of the sky. Hopefully in the future, cities will save energy and money, while having appropriately lit streets, dark bedrooms, and a sky once again full of stars.

Lots more information, including details of preliminary results, is available on the project blog: http://lossofthenight.blogspot.com and the campaign website of seeing stars Leiden: https://seeingstarsleiden.pocket.science/

You are welcome to get into contact with the light pollution researchers from Verlust der Nacht that built this app, and learn about their other projects (https://www.verlustdernacht.de). The app also provides some basic information on the history, importance, and consequences of artificial light at night.

However, current human water- and land-use patterns and emissions from our socio-industrial and consumption practices undermine the capacity of natural ecosystems in water and on land to regenerate themselves to remain a healthy basis for diverse forms of life. The health of interconnected water and soil systems is deteriorating at an ever-faster pace. Potential impacts from climate change threaten to accelerate this decline. Just reducing our harmful impacts will no longer suffice. We need to take regenerative action. Restoring healthy water bodies is also a fundamental need to make the planet’s life support system with water and earth more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change.  But where should we act first, and what actions promise success?  EU Data sets relating to water quality are expensive to obtain and accordingly scantly distributed across time and space. Most data related to large rivers but not smaller streams that may flow through biodiversity-rich areas. 

Citizen science can play an important role in complementing official data sets on water quality to identify pollution hot spots, in particular in small streams that are not usually monitored by experts (König et al., 2020).  This APP provides a citizen science tool to explore water quality and ecosystem health where you stand and can take action.  Data collected with this APP can 
inform you and any citizen in an accessible manner on where regenerative action for healthy water bodies might be most urgently needed, 
open new windows on compliance with EU water quality standards and on the effectiveness of Luxembourg policy making and implementation,

This PhD project aims to examine the potential of “crowdsourcing”, meaning observations of voluntary participants. As the name suggests, the project looks at the potential of crowdsourcing in the field of hydrology. We will collect water level, streamflow and soil moisture data. The project will not only look at the possibilities of collecting data but also at the value of this data for hydrological forecasts. The long-term aim of the project is to collect a large amount of data and to improve the forecast of hydrological events, such as droughts or floods.

There are two basic parts of the CrowdWater project. On the one hand, we will assess public involvement in hydrological observations. For this we use a “geocaching” type approach with the help of smartphones. By using an app that will be developed over the coming months, users can install a virtual measuring station. Anyone can then add their observations to this station and all observations will be collected and published anonymously on the CrowdWater homepage. Another goal of the CrowdWater project is to analyse the potential of using the collected data for hydrological models. This question will be addressed by using hydrological computer models to predict streamflow. These models will assess the benefit of the crowd-sourced data.

At the moment the app is under development, so for now we are collecting data with the help of information boards and paper forms at various locations in the greater Zurich area. This data will help us to improve our methodology and enables us to make a first assessment of the data quality. As soon as new stations are installed, we will post the location here and on facebook.

PlantNet Plant Identification,PlantNet,org.plantnet,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.plantnet&hl=en&gl=us,"Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand! Pl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it. 

Pl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads or cacti. Pl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature of course but also those that grow on the sidewalks of our cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!

The more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. Flowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant (or the tree if it is one!) is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.  

At present Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. Don't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.

The new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:
- The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.
- The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).
- The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application. 
- The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.
- The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.
- The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.
- The mapping of your observations.
- Links to many factsheets.

Aquaculture Production,Agricultural Research Council,arc.ict.aquacultureproductionsa,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=arc.ict.aquacultureproductionsa&hl=en&gl=us,"Fresh water aquaculture is an important source of food, income, employment, and recreation. The sector contributes to economic development and food security in South Africa (Emmanuel et al, 2014). For decades aquaculture has been widely recognized globally as the fastest-growing food production sector with a growth of 7.5% annually since 1994. Its contribution to the South African economy grew by 10.7% per annum over the same period. Also, a DAFF (2019) report has   estimated that a revenue of R3Bn is expected to be contributed by aquaculture in South African economy, with 15 000 people to benefit from direct and full-time employment.

A majority of small-scale commercial farmers are not profitable in South Africa, with poor management practices identified as a major constraint (Taylor, 2022). As a result of poor management practices, fish farmers are losing about 70% of their profit. Maintaining a good culture environment through use of proper management practices reduces the risk of disease, increase production, fish quality, and marketability. Therefore, it is essential to implement and follow good aquaculture management practices to ensure quality and quantity yield. The major management practices necessary for effective production includes fish stocking density, feeding, water quality control, diseases control and record keeping. Also, Good management practices in aquaculture maximizes the environmental and economic sustainability, product quality and safety, animal health, and worker safety, while also strengthening biosecurity and minimizing the likelihood of a disease outbreak on fish farms. Also, good management practices for aquaculture does not only maximizes production but also plays a role in the sustainability of the farming system and the biosecurity associated with the farmed species.

The Citizen Scientist app uses a technology called ""ecological momentary assessment"" to monitor how the surrounding environment affects our mental wellbeing.
This technology involves presenting people with a prompt at random times, inviting them to answer questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. 
After answering the questions, participants are also invited to take a photograph of the ground or floor where they are standing and/or a short audio recording of their current environment.

Once you start answering the questions you will be able to access an individualised report which summarises your experiences. 

In addition, Citizen Scientist integrates with the Health app to record information about geographical location data; participants can decide whether or not to provide this information.

The data will help us understand how different aspects of the surrounding environment affect mental wellbeing, and will be used to inform novel clinical interventions and the planning and design of healthier cities.

Stall Catchers,Games for Health,com.gamesolutionslab.stallcatchers,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamesolutionslab.stallcatchers&hl=en&gl=us,"Stall Catchers is an online game that anyone can play - no experience necessary. In the game, you look at movies from the brains of mice and try to identify vessels as flowing or stalled. This helps to speed up Alzheimer's disease research at Cornell University.

Stall Catchers is part of the EyesOnALZ project. The game was built on one of the oldest volunteer thinking projects: stardust@home, and is using the Virtual Microscope developed by their team. Who knew stardust and blood vessels could be so similar?

Currently, our catchers range from 6 to 88 years old.  A large part of our community includes middle school students, seniors, caregivers and Alzheimer’s patients themselves.

The game is easy to grasp, and we walk you through in the beginning. Check out the 'How to' section in the main menu if you need help at any time. Don't worry about making mistakes - each blood vessel is analysed by multiple catchers, and we ensure we generate reliable crowd answers in the end.

EyesOnALZ is a citizen science project developed by the Human Computation Institute. The project enables everyone to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease research and speed up the search for a treatment. Our first citizen science game - Stall Catchers - was launched in October 2016 and now gathers thousands of volunteers.

The idea was born in 2015, when by a lucky coincidence, Pietro Michelucci met Chris Schaffer, whose lab was in need of citizen scientists’ help. The project was funded by the BrightFocus Foundation and officially began in early 2016.

EyesOnALZ includes collaborators from the Schaffer-Nishimura Lab at Cornell University, stardust@home team at U.C. Berkeley and SciStarter.com. Previous collaborators include Sebastian Seung’s Laboratory at Princeton University, WiredDifferently and others.

EyesOnALZ and Stall Catchers are being developed by the Human Computation Institute, and supported by a team of collaborators, advisors and volunteers from Cornell University, UC Berkeley, SciStarter, and elsewhere worldwide.

The EyesOnALZ Android app is being developed for Human Computation Institute in partnership with Games For Health Europe by Game Solutions Lab.

Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation.

Cosmology is a branch of astronomy concerned with the studies of the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future.

Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. Among the subjects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background.

A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.

The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.

A constellation is an area on the celestial sphere in which a group of visible stars forms a perceived outline or pattern, typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, or an inanimate object.

Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail.

An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. There are many methods of detecting exoplanets. Transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy have found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star.

A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed.

A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that does not dominate its region of space (as a planet does) and is not a satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of the Sun and is massive enough to be plastic – for its gravity to maintain it in a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid) – but has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit of similar objects.

A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.

A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus, in which a supermassive black hole with mass ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk.

- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. 

- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the ""Map"" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.

- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!
