However, current human water- and land-use patterns and emissions from our socio-industrial and consumption practices undermine the capacity of natural ecosystems in water and on land to regenerate themselves to remain a healthy basis for diverse forms of life. The health of interconnected water and soil systems is deteriorating at an ever-faster pace. Potential impacts from climate change threaten to accelerate this decline Just reducing our harmful impacts will no longer suffice. We need to take regenerative action. Restoring healthy water bodies is also a fundamental need to make the planet’s life support system with water and earth more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change.

The module and this companion app reveal the silent and often times invisible world of bats, providing outdoor enthusiasts, citizen scientists, and researchers an affordable and informative way to interact with these important creatures. There are two models: Echo Meter Touch 2 (EMT 2) is intended for nature enthusiasts and batting hobbyists and Echo Meter Touch 2 Pro is designed for bat professionals and features a higher quality microphone, adjustable gain, and higher sample rate.

The Echo Meter Touch Ultrasonic Module senses ultrasonic signals, digitizes the signal, and transmits the ultrasonic data to the app on your iOS device. 

LISTEN TO BAT’S ECHOLOCATIONS
EMT2 translates bat echolocations into frequencies that are audible to humans using two technologies. Wildlife Acoustics’ patented Real Time Expansion (RTE) allows you to listen to bats in real time with unparalleled fidelity. RTE maintains the timing and tonality of the original echolocations. Heterodyne (HET) listening via manual and automatic tuning is also available, for those accustomed to that way of hearing bats. 

VIEW THE ECHOLOCATIONS ON A SPECTROGRAM
A real-time spectrogram shows the frequencies and timing of the echolocations. Scroll back in time and zoom in on previous ""bat passes.""  

SEE MOST LIKELY BAT SPECIES IN REAL-TIME***
The Auto ID feature analyzes the echolocation calls and suggests the two most likely bat species matches in real time. This is the same technology used in our professional Kaleidoscope Pro Bat Auto Identification software. Currently, the app can identify 26 species in North America, 25 in Europe and 57 in the neotropics. For more information on Kaleidoscope and a full list of species, visit our website.

RECORD .WAV FILES
Activate triggered recording mode to automatically save bat passes to full spectrum .wav files for analysis on a computer or to view on your iDevice. Or use manual record mode to control start and stop of recording. View the recording spectrogram and add voice or text notes. Listen to the recording using RTE, HET, or traditional Time Expansion Playback (playback at fractional speed to make the ultrasound audible).

SEE YOUR PATH AND RECORDING LOCATIONS
View in satellite or road map view. View identified species codes directly on the map. Go to the recording's spectrogram from the map view. Transfer to your computer to view in Google Earth. Your iDevice must have GPS capability or you must use a Bluetooth GPS receiver for this functionality.
*Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*

TRANSFER RECORDINGS TO YOUR COMPUTER 
The EMT 2 can transfer the .wav recordings to your computer over a Wi-Fi network or using a USB cable. 

SHARE RECORDINGS VIA EMAIL OR MMS MESSAGING 
And import and open files that have been shared with you.

***Because bats vary their echolocation calls in response to a wide variety of needs, no automated identification can achieve 100% accuracy in species identification. Auto-ID, though largely accurate, should not be relied on as a basis for scientific research. Auto-ID is intended for use in analyzing recordings of single bats in free flight in low clutter environments. Auto-ID will not work well on recordings of roost emergence, multiple or captive bats, bats in high clutter environments, or bat social calls. Auto-ID does not include every possible bat for each of the covered regions.",['EN']

Die Gründe dafür umfassen unter anderem die Zerstörung und Degradierung von Lebensräumen, diverse Pilzkrankheiten sowie Veränderungen in der Landnutzung. Für einige Amphibienarten gehören, trotz vieler Störungen, auch landwirtschaftliche Gebiete oder gar Städte zu wichtigen Lebensräumen. Unsere Zielart ist die bedrohte Wechselkröte - eine typische Pionierart, die neu entstehende Gewässer schnell besiedeln kann. In Österreich liegt ihr Hauptverbreitungsgebiet in Ostösterreich mit vereinzelten inselartigen Vorkommen im Westen. Ihre natürlichen Laichgewässer sind nach Regenfällen gefüllte Steppenseen oder nach Überschwemmungen entstandene Tümpel mit starker Sonneneinstrahlung. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen, sind die natürlichen Laich-Habitate der Wechselkröte in Europa weitgehend verschwunden. Neben diesen naturnahen Gewässern werden heute oft künstliche Gewässer oder Lacken, die nach Regengüssen gefüllt sind, von Wechselkröten angenommen. Das Verschwinden von Brachflächen und Verschließen von Baulücken führt jedoch sowohl im ländlichen als auch im innerstädtischen Gebiet zu einer Verschlechterung des Erhaltungszustandes der Wechselkröte. Gegenmaßnahmen, wie beispielsweise die Bereitstellung von Ersatzlebensräumen, wirken dieser negativen Entwicklung entgegen.

Projektziele von AmphiBiom
Ein wichtiger Schritt für ein umfassendes Schutzkonzept für die Wechselkröte erfordert eine österreichweite Bestandsaufnahme und Analyse ihrer Habitat-Präferenzen unter Einbeziehung von Schadstoffen in den Gewässern und der Landnutzung. Das vorliegende Projekt nutzt Citizen Science zur Untersuchung dieser Pionierart, um die Verbreitung in Arealen, die oftmals für die Forschung unzugänglich sind (z.B. Privatgärten), zu untersuchen und Bürger*innen aktiv in das Projekt einzubinden. Darüber hinaus ist es ein Ziel den Teilnehmenden zu zeigen, dass sie selbst durch nur wenig Aufwand (z.B. durch die Anlage von Kleingewässern) das Überleben dieser geschützten Art fördern können. Diese Lebensraumschaffung wird den Erhaltungszustand der Wechselkröten und anderer bedrohter Amphibien-Pionierarten erheblich verbessern. Wir erwarten zudem eine große Vielfalt wirbelloser Tiere (z.B. Insekten), die zu einer Zunahme der Biodiversität in ganz Österreich beitragen wird. Unsere Analysen werden uns ermöglichen, klare Handlungsweisen zum Schutz dieser seltenen Biotope zu geben. Die Involvierung von Bürger*innen ermöglicht hier die breite Ausrollung unserer Initiative, erhöht die Nachhaltigkeit der Aktion und schafft ein Problembewusstsein für Biodiversitätsschutz in Österreich. 

Wie können Sie mitmachen?
Bevor Sie mittels App aktiv teilnehmen können, müssen Sie sich registrieren oder einloggen. Für die Teilnahme am Projekt AmphiBiom bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten. Haben Sie auf einem abendlichen Spaziergang eine Wechselkröte, oder ein anderes Amphib, gehört, dann können Sie den Ruf direkt in der App aufzeichnen und melden. Sie haben auch die Möglichkeit sich aktiv in der Laichgewässerschaffung für Wechselkröten zu engagieren. Hierfür steht ein eigenes Online-Formular über www.amphi.at zur Verfügung.

Together with youths from nine European countries – Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom – you can share your daily life experiences of participation, belonging, and citizenship in your community.  You can share which places you spend time, what activities you do, with whom you spend time, and what these places, people, and activities mean to you. When do you feel that you belong and take part in society and the local community? What makes you feel supported, strengthened, and have a voice? You know better than anyone else, what your daily lived experiences of inclusion and exclusion are.

We invite you to be a young researcher and share your experiences with other youths and researchers in the YouCount App. We also invite you to create new knowledge and innovations for social change in cooperation with other youths and local people, organizations, and authorities in your community. 

YouCount is a research project funded by the European Union and we aim to address one of Europe’s most pressing challenges: How to increase social inclusion for young people?

Using the HerpMapper mobile app, you can create records of your herp observations and keep them all in one place. In turn, your data is made available to HerpMapper Partners – groups who use your recorded observations for research, conservation, and preservation purposes. Your observations can make valuable contributions on the behalf of amphibians and reptiles.

Using your phone’s camera and GPS capabilities, the HerpMapper mobile app creates a ‘voucher record’ of your find, incorporating photos of the animal, and recording the location.  For calling frogs and toads, the app enables you to record and include a sound file in a record.  The date and time of day are also recorded.  The app features a searchable database of the common and scientific names for all of the world’s herpetofauna, and you can search for either type of name by entering just a fragment.  The newest version of the app allows you to add multiple photos and soundfiles to a record

The HerpMapper mobile app does not require wireless or cellular service in order to properly record locations - it uses your phone’s native GPS device, which remains in satellite contact when outside (many HerpMapper records have been recorded in remote corners of the globe).  Once you are back in wireless or cellular range, you can upload (sync) your collected records to the HerpMapper database.  Once uploaded, you can view any and all of your records from the HerpMapper website (www.herpmapper.org).  Creating a HerpMapper account is fast, simple, and free, and you can use the site and the mobile app to keep track of your finds, build a life list, and contribute to science and herp conservation!  Instructions for creating an account, and installing and using the mobile app, are listed on the HerpMapper website.

Who can see the records you create? There are two levels of visibility for records. Only you and HerpMapper Partners have access to all of the data in the records you create. Other users of HerpMapper and the general public can only see very basic information in your records – they do not have access to exact locality data. Any pictures attached to a record have their locality metadata stripped, so they can be seen by everyone on the HerpMapper website, which means you can also see the cool herps being recorded by other people from around the world.

Who are HerpMapper's Partners? For the most part, they are biologists working for state or regional agencies, university researchers, or conservation organizations across the globe. A list of HerpMapper Partners is maintained on the HerpMapper website.",[]

About the Sightings Network

The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a research and conservation program of the Vancouver Aquarium in collaboration with the Cetacean Research Program of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

The Sightings Network is a network of thousands of observers across British Columbia who report their sightings of whales, dolphins, porpoises and sea turtles. Anyone can be an observer and every report improves our understanding of the distribution and occurrence of cetaceans and sea turtles in B.C. waters.

There are 12 species or populations of cetaceans and sea turtles native to British Columbia listed under the Species at Risk Act. These species face many threats from human activity such as entanglement in fishing gear, disturbance by vessels, and accumulation of pollutants.

Learn more about cetaceans, sea turtles and their conservation at www.wildwhales.org.

How Sightings Network Data is Used

The data collected are used in conservation and research-based projects to better understand and protect cetacean and sea turtles in B.C. waters. Sightings are not made available to the public so as to avoid advertising cetacean and sea turtles hot spots, and contributing to vessel disturbance to cetaceans and sea turtles in these areas. Data can be requested for use in academic research, conservation assessment and planning, species recovery planning including critical habitat determination, and environmental impact assessment, evaluation and mitigation.

This app was made possible through the generous support of Mountain Equipment Co-op, BG Group, and the Government of Canada.

This project was undertaken with the financial support of the Government of Canada provided through the Department of the Environment.

This pest was introduced accidentally to mainland Europe in 2014 (EPPO 2014) and can easily spread in the course of trade and the movement of goods and people. P. japonica threatens the entire agricultural sector, urban landscapes, and biodiversity in invaded areas.

Prevention of the species’ invasion faces two constraints: The possibilities to restrict the movement of goods and people are limited, and successful eradication of the population established south of the Italian-Suisse border is impossible. With the IPM (Integrated Pest Management) Citizen Science App, the public can contribute sightings of the Japanese Beetle and participate in location monitoring. The App allows recording beetle sightings selection of damaged crops, fruits, vegetables, and other plant species. With your Citizen Science observations for agricultural fields or in your garden and private horticulture, you help the team of IPM Popillia to combat the invasive species and ensure food safety in agriculture in Europe, the US, and beyond.

Recently, EFSA and the JCR of the European commission have nominated P. japonica as a candidate high priority pest in the new EU Plant health Law. Against this background, it is paramount to develop measures that help to confine the spread of the new pest and prevent the build-up of high population densities that cause economic loss to agricultural crops and increase migration pressure of the Japanese beetles.

The project IPM-Popillia develops these measures. It involves teams working in the core of the recent outbreak area, conducting fit-for-purpose practical research in a European environment that can be applied immediately as short-term containment measures. In the longer term, IPM-Popillia provides tools and advice on managing the pest on a larger, European continental scale and how to be better prepared for similar pest invasions in the future.

You have the unique opportunity to contribute to this cutting-edge research from the comfort of your home, using your phone, tablet, or computer.

Our app brings the cosmos to your fingertips. When two neutron stars merge, they create a powerful event, sending gravitational waves through space. These events are detected by our gravitational wave detectors, which alert us to potential black hole formations. Mergers of this kind not only create black holes but also give birth to rare Earth elements such as Iodine, Gold, and Cerium. All these elements, especially Iodine, play crucial roles in supporting life as we know it.

In addition to gravitational waves, these cosmic collisions emit light signals. The chase is on to detect these signals with our trio of specially designed BlackGEM telescopes located in Chile. The catch is that the detectors only provide a general localization of the event and the light signals are fleeting. Therefore, we need to act quickly to capture these signals before they fade away after a few days or a week at most.

That's where you come in! Using our app, you will sift through real-time images of the sky taken by our BlackGEM telescopes. You will help us spot these light signals, effectively identifying potential new black holes. Not only will you be possibly among the first to set eyes on the light from these celestial events, but with some training, you may also direct telescopes to take additional measurements of intriguing objects.

Your contributions to science won't go unnoticed. Participants who make significant discoveries will be offered co-authorship on scientific publications that result from their findings. We also provide training and guidance to enrich your understanding of the cosmos.

Get involved as a citizen scientist by using The Ocean Cleanup Survey App to help The Ocean Cleanup and the global community better understand ocean plastic pollution. Developed by The Ocean Cleanup’s leading scientists this app is simple to handle and allows you to report to a global database the plastic load in a river or ocean near you using your smartphone. This is the first plastic counting app that enables you to report plastic pollution in real time.

Why use The Ocean Cleanup Survey App? It is fun, it is easy, and it generates important global data for citizens, scientists, and decision makers to move forward in reducing ocean plastic pollution. By using The Ocean Cleanup Survey App you can join our mission to rid the world’s oceans of plastic and become part of the largest cleanup in history.

How to perform an Ocean Cleanup Survey? Download the The Ocean Cleanup Survey App, go to a river or ocean of your choice during daylight, and pick a safe survey location such as a bridge with a decent pedestrian area for a river survey or the bow of your vessel for an ocean survey. Next, log in to your account and choose a survey duration. You are now ready to record in real time the plastic items you identify on the water surface by tapping the categories on the screen.

Using The Ocean Cleanup Survey Apps rewarding:

- Contribute to a global understanding of plastic pollution
- Help The Ocean Cleanup understand optimal mitigation strategies for rivers and oceans
- Use our defined categories to count waste items in real time on your screen
- View your results on our global citizen science map

Why do we need Plastic Surveys? Rivers represent a major source of plastic pollution. They are widely believed to be the arteries that carry waste from land to the ocean. With over 8 billion tons of plastic produced to date, a significant fraction of discarded products have been leaking into the environment, entering waterways, and reaching the ocean via rivers. We now know that this is currently happening everywhere in the world and we estimate that over 1000 rivers are responsible for 80% of the global riverine plastic inputs into the ocean. The understanding of waste types and quantitative fluxes is important to better inform interception strategies. The data generated by this app (thanks to you) will allow scientists to refine numerical models simulating the terrestrial transport of plastic to the oceans and its accumulation at the sea surface. These results will be directly impacting the design and deployment strategy of river and offshore cleanup solutions.

Become a part of the largest cleanup in history. As our global database grows, and if you are interested, we might invite you by email to take part in a special survey campaign at one of our rivers or ocean areas of interest.

The Ocean Cleanup Survey App only collects information pertinent to surveying and collects your name and email address for authentication and communication purposes.

Then you know it can get very hot because of all the asphalt and the concrete that retains the heat! Staying cool in this heat is not only a problem for humans, but also for animals. But this is just one of the challenges they face. The city is a completely new environment that they must be able to adapt to. Cities can therefore be seen as ""living laboratories"" where evolution takes place in real time! In the project we want to investigate through Citizen Science how spiders can adapt to city life.

We focus on two important spider traits: color and webs. 
Spider color: Much like a white car heats up less in the sun compared to a black car, so does a lighter spider heat up less compared to a dark spider. Therefore we expect city spiders to evolve a more lighter color as this protects them from overheating in an already hot city. 

Spider webs: As the main tool for prey capture, webs are crucial for spider survival. Due to a lower supply of prey in cities, we expect to see webs with a smaller mesh size that are more efficient in capturing prey.

Why study adaptations to city living in spiders?
Not only do we get crucial information about how animals can adapt to climate change, studying spiders can also be very useful for us humans! We can use spider color as a natural thermometer and thus better determine how quickly our environment heats up. And who knows, by examining in detail how a spider uses color to stay cool, we might even find new ways of staying cool in the city ourselves.

This PhD project aims to examine the potential of “crowdsourcing”, meaning observations of voluntary participants. As the name suggests, the project looks at the potential of crowdsourcing in the field of hydrology. We will collect water level, streamflow and soil moisture data. The project will not only look at the possibilities of collecting data but also at the value of this data for hydrological forecasts. The long-term aim of the project is to collect a large amount of data and to improve the forecast of hydrological events, such as droughts or floods.

There are two basic parts of the CrowdWater project. On the one hand, we will assess public involvement in hydrological observations. For this we use a “geocaching” type approach with the help of smartphones. By using an app that will be developed over the coming months, users can install a virtual measuring station. Anyone can then add their observations to this station and all observations will be collected and published anonymously on the CrowdWater homepage. Another goal of the CrowdWater project is to analyse the potential of using the collected data for hydrological models. This question will be addressed by using hydrological computer models to predict streamflow. These models will assess the benefit of the crowd-sourced data.

At the moment the app is under development, so for now we are collecting data with the help of information boards and paper forms at various locations in the greater Zurich area. This data will help us to improve our methodology and enables us to make a first assessment of the data quality. As soon as new stations are installed, we will post the location here and on facebook.

A queen spends her life laying eggs, most of which grow into workers. During a short period of the year, when it is time to start new colonies, some eggs grow into virgin males and queens that are winged. These virgin males and queens participate in nuptial flights where they form a mating ball in the air. Males from one colony mate with queens from other colonies. After mating, the males die. The newly-mated queens rip off their wings and search for new homes to start their colonies. 

Our project has two goals. First, we want to enable scientists to use the timing of ant nuptial flights to monitor environmental changes on a global scale. Second, we want to help people collect ants in a less destructive and disruptive manner.

To achieve these goal, we have developed AntNupTracker as a tool for reporting ant nuptial flights from the field. Using this app, we are building an open and publicly-accessible database of ant nuptial flight records. This database can either be browsed in the app, online or downloaded in the format of your choice. Whether you are a beginner or a professional myrmecologist, we invite you to share in our passion for ants and contribute to this citizen science project!

Dog waste is a significant problem in the UK and across the globe.  There are approximately 8.5 million dogs in the UK alone with roughly 25% of all households currently owning a dog.  And with each dog needing to defecate up to 5 times every day that could mean a staggering 42.5 million dog poops per day that need to be dealt with.

Many dog owners are responsible and clean up after their pooch but we all know that too many are not as socially responsible, leading to the pollution of environments that are there for all us to enjoy and share.  Not only an inconvenience, dog poo also poses substantial health risks to humans (particular young children) and to animals including commercially important livestock.

Much of our island’s fragile history is simply being washed away. Coastal erosion can rarely be halted, but at least archaeological sites can be recorded before they are destroyed. CITiZAN, the Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network, encourages data collection through our app by volunteers like you!

Smart phones and tablets are powerful archaeological recording tools: with a camera and GPS facilities they are perfect for locating and recording new archaeological features. As we already carry this tool around wherever we go, it is ideal for long-term monitoring of archaeological features at risk on England’s coastlines and estuaries.

The remains of prehistoric forests and settlements, Roman forts and villas, ancient salt-working sites, medieval ports, fishing settlements, harbour works and countless abandoned boats, barges and ships are all under threat. But all of these vulnerable sites have a unique story to tell: about England’s first settlers, its maritime industries, the defence of the realm against waves of would-be invaders. There is also information to be collected about sea-level change, about the speed of coastal erosion, about the changing landscape and land use along the ever-changing coast.

CITiZAN feature map:

The 80,000+ points on our interactive feature map provide information on England’s coastal and intertidal heritage from low tide to 100m inland from mean high water. They offer a snapshot of integrated data from Historic England, National Trust, several local Historic Environment Record offices and local archaeology groups.  As a user you can:

1.            View our interactive map of England’s coastal and intertidal heritage.

2.            Add to the national record by creating new CITiZAN feature points.

3.            Keep this national record accurate by updating existing points with your survey and monitoring information.

About us:

CITiZAN, the Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network, is generously funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, with match funding from National Trust and the Crown Estate and additional support from Historic England. In order to provide support to our volunteers, we are based in three offices across England, hosted in London by MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) together with our partners the Council for British Archaeology in York and the Nautical Archaeology Society in Portsmouth.

The app uses background location tracking to provide a better experience, however, just to warn you that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

Coastal regions will have to adapt to these changes, adaptation measures however cost money. Decisions on which coasts to protect and how to do so are often based on calculations of risk. These calculations are made by 'Integrated assessment models'. They take in huge amounts of data on coastal zones defined by hundreds of parameters.

One of these parameters is the coast material. It determines how vulnerable a given coast is to erosion. Sandy beaches erode more easily than rocky cliffs; erosion raises the risk. 

And here lies the problem. We don’t have sufficient data for this parameter. The only comprehensive global dataset on coast material to be found was created in the year 1958. (And it was stolen from the library by the professor to be quickly scanned and then returned. True story.)

“Global assessments of vulnerability to climate-change induced sea-level rise and of its associated impacts are impeded by the severe lack of information on coastal physical characteristics.” Prof. A. Vafeidis (University of Kiel, Germany)

So, this is where the App comes in. And you. Help us create a global database of coast material by sending us pictures of coasts. Take a picture (or more) whenever you stroll along a coast or browse through your pictures and upload those you already have. You don't need an account, just the App.

Its aim is to enable the general public (amateurs and professionals) to receive and share information about Invasive Alien Species (IAS) in Europe. Specifically, the app’s purposes are: 
1) to allow recording invasive species occurrences by using citizen phones’ GPS system and phones’ cameras;
2) to provide information about a selected number of IAS (pictures, short description, addition useful information);
3) to foster citizens’ awareness about the problems caused by IAS in Europe and actively getting the public involved in the management of IAS.
This app includes a preliminary selection of IAS of European priority. More species are expected to be added in subsequent releases of the app., following the progress of the European policy on IAS.
Alien Species are increasing worldwide and are currently present in almost every ecosystem type on Earth. They belong to all major taxonomic groups, including viruses, fungi, algae, mosses, ferns, higher plants, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. In some cases they have become invasive, affecting native biota. Invasive alien species can transform the structure and species composition of ecosystems by repressing or excluding native species, either directly by predation, competing with them for resources, or indirectly by modifying habitats. The effects to human health include the spread of diseases and allergens, while to the economy there can be damage to agriculture and infrastructure.
It is estimated that 10-15 % of the alien species identified in Europe are invasive, causing environmental, economic and/or social damage. 
Recognising the increasingly serious problem of IAS in Europe, the European Commission has recently published a dedicated Regulation on Invasive Alien Species (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_317_R_0003). Implementation of this Regulation will be supported by an information system developed by the JRC (http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about).

With the GROW Observatory app you can

- Explore the Edible Plant Database and get plant information that is tailored to your specific location. You can also select plants that you can grow “right now”, at your respective location.
- Get detailed, science based information on regenerative growing practices. This includes practices that help improve your soil and support the wider ecosystem.

Participants of the GROW Changing Climate mission  in one of the 9  GROW places can use the app to record and share data about landscape features, soil properties and land management activities.

The app also links you with other GROW resources, such as the GROW Observatory Medium blog, website, or Facebook page.

GROW Food: Edible Plant Database – EPD

The Edible Plant Database offers a list of plants which you can grow in your location. You can also specifically look at plants which you can plant where you are, at the current time of year. You can explore detailed information about each plant, such as plant images and a description of the plant. It tells you about special requirements for optimal growing, such as sunlight or nutrient requirements or the optimum germination temperature, which is the temperature at which seeds will sprout best. Also, you get information on planting and harvesting dates for each plant, that are specific to your location and that often differ significantly across Europe.

GROW Practices: Regenerative Practices

The GROW Practices app module offers science based information on regenerative growing practices that help improve your soil as well as practices that help support the wider ecosystem. Each practice is described in detail and it includes overall benefits of the practice, special considerations you need to be aware of. It also includes examples and hands-on tips if you want to try the practice in your own garden or food growing plot.

GROW Science: Record and share data on land and soil

The GROW Observatory project also runs special missions, such as the GROW Changing Climate Mission  in 9 GROW places. Mission participants use the app to record in-situ land and soil information that is linked to a specific location and soil moisture sensor.

The Land Survey
With the app, mission participants record information on - for example - land use and land cover as well as topography of a sensor site. They also take pictures in each cardinal direction and of the sensor on the ground. This additional information is essential for properly interpreting the soil moisture data from the sensors.

The Soil Survey
Apart from landscape data, mission participants also perform a soil test and - with the app - record information on soil texture and stone content. This information is again essential for interpreting the soil moisture data from the sensors. 

Recording land management activities
During the soil moisture sensing period it is also important to document any management activities undertaken around the senor. Therefore, mission participants can continuously record activities such as irrigating, fertilizing, mulching, and others.

Cities are a familiar and extreme example of this change. Intriguingly, some animals can adapt to these changed environments by flexibly changing their behaviour. The project focuses on five bird species that have done so successfully: Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Australian Brush-turkey, Australian White Ibis, Little Corella, and Long-billed Corella. Additional species can be reported by selecting “other.”   

The five focal species have all been observed adapting to human modified areas , and are increasing their population in urban areas. Occasionally they are considered a nuisance, yet they are all Australian native birds that are doing their best to survive in human altered landscapes. The data collected will help scientists understand these species’ behaviour, movement, reproduction, distribution, and habitat use in suburban areas. We aim to use this information to help understand the behavioural traits that have allowed some species to adapt to the challenges and opportunities of city living.

The country has an extensive network of protected areas including parks, reserves and forests, private and community sanctuaries, and still some remaining natural areas which still support wild animals. About 390 mammal species occur in Kenya. The distribution of these species in Kenya is not well known. Many people believe that the study of nature/mammals is an exclusive field of people who graduate from universities.

However, anybody can be a naturalist, if that person has passion for nature/mammals. That passion can be manifested in keenness in observations, photography and documentation of mammals - all of which can contribute significant information for understanding and conservation of the natural world of mammals. In July 2020, Kenya had a population of more than 50 million. Wherever one lives there are mammals, since mammal species occur everywhere, in the air, on land, in water and underground - in and outside protected areas. In addition, each year visitors from abroad come to Kenya on vacations. For example, in 2019 alone more than 2 million people from abroad toured Kenya. Harnessing the power of technology, especially the mobile based citizen science monitoring of mammals can contribute significant data that can help us to understand the distribution of Kenyan mammals.

The MAKENYA - Mammal Atlas Kenya project is a Kenyan citizen (public) science mobile based application to monitor mammals. The MAKENYA app can be freely downloaded and installed on a smartphone for use to record and report any type of mammal species one sees anywhere in Kenya. Any record/sighting of mammal species submitted is useful data which can help save that species in the long run.

The main aim of project MAKENYA are:
* Involve everyone in the study of Kenyan mammals
* Encourage everyone to contribute sightings of common and rare mammals 
* Produce distribution maps of different mammal species in Kenya
* Analyse sighting data and publish in peer-reviewed journals

The first continental phenology project in the Southern Hemisphere, ClimateWatch enables every Australian to be involved in collecting and recording data that will help shape our country’s scientific response to climate change.

What is phenology?
Phenology is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate. Examples include bird nesting, insect hatching, plant flowering, and fruit ripening. Many studies have already provided insight into the relationship between climate variables, such as temperature and rainfall, to the timing of these phenophases. Monitoring phenology is important as changes can impact entire biological communities, our food sources, and our environment. Unfortunately few significant datasets have been collected and researched in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere.

We need your help capturing the impact climate change is having on our plants and wildlife. With our free ClimateWatch app, you can gather information in your own backyard, on the way to school, in your school ground, or at a local park. The information you collect will help us develop adaptation strategies for species’ survival into the future.

SoilPlastic,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soilplastic/id1622415639?uo=4,SPOTTERON Gmbh,0.0,USD,"Plastic use has facilitated many practices in agriculture in the past decades. However, the increased application leads to aggregations of plastic in the fields in various contents. From the different plastic debris micro-, and nano-plastics (MNP) are derived and are small enough to be ingested by a wide range of organisms and can cross biological barriers at nano-scale and enter plant systems.
This emerging risk has prompted first studies that confirmed the high potential of accumulation of MP in soils causing changes in physico-chemical soil properties. Consequently, this can cause alternation of soil functions such as soil water dynamics and ultimately affect related ecosystem services (ESS) like nutrient cycling, plant growth, and soil biodiversity, which have unmeasured impacts on the economy of the farm. These effects could be even magnified with the presence of MP in combination of other soil pollutants, such as pesticides and veterinary drugs or plastic additives (e.g. dyes), potentially exhibiting synergistic effects.
Within the EU research project ‘Minagris’ these interactive mechanisms are explored and documented. This App /’SoilPlastic’ motivates and engages various stakeholders to contribute to this process by observing and documenting plastic residues/littering in and on soils, submitting anonymized content to a global database. The aim is to identify needs, improve farmer and citizen awareness, provide practitioners with scientifically sound guidance on the impact of different plastic uses and inputs on soil ecosystems – enabling them to make informed decisions – and joint development of novel strategies for reducing plastic contamination. Additionally, with the observed data, a better understanding of any potentially harmful impacts of plastic debris to soil functions, soil biodiversity, related ESS, agricultural productivity at the field level, and related socio-economic consequences at farm level is provided.

The PartiCollect (powered by NanoObs and PartiCiTaE) project allows you take part in mapping fine-particle air pollution in the city by collecting samples in your environment. These samples are then sent to the scientific team, made up of researchers based at three universities in the Paris region. Using magnetic and chemical measurements, the scientific team can identify and quantify metallic pollutants, which are largely linked to car traffic and are known to have harmful effects on health. These metallic particles come from exhaust fumes, but some are also emitted by braking and tire wear. They are then deposited on surrounding objects, such as plants.

Plane tree bark is particularly well suited to this type of study. Plane trees are very common in  cities, especially along or near streets, and they are therefore particularly exposed. These trees renew their bark every year, so it is possible to take samples without damaging them, in order to assess the quantity of particles accumulated over a year.

The precise location of the samples is a crucial parameter.

This will become part of long-term climate change scientific research working to understand how this region of Sweden is changing – all you need is your phone.

Guided by Nature offers a range of hiking trails for all abilities, and differing adventures for both summer and winter explorations of the national park. Guided walks are available in English and Swedish. Guided by Nature is a registered charity in Sweden (802539-7186).

Everybody is welcome to participate!

The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is worldwide one of the most threatened bird species. A free-ranging colony was established in 1997 at the Core facility Konrad Lorenz Forschungsstelle (KLF) for Behaviour and Cognition of the University of Vienna in Grünau im Almtal (Upper Austria). This colony provided valuable information for reintroduction projects in Europe.

The project WaldrApp focuses on the ecological aspects of the areas used by the birds. Preliminary results show that NBI select their foraging grounds according to different ecological parameters: sites with a high distance to roads, houses and trees as well as short vegetation are clearly preferred.

Habitat selection depends mainly on the current resource availability. In addition, social animals are particularly prone to show site fidelity and to form traditions. The birds spend the winter and the breeding season in the Almtal valley, while they can be found in about 30 km air-line distance from the KLF over the summer (Kremstal, this habit has been established since 2008).

Later on, the acquired information and the app itself could be adapted worldwide for other NBI populations and reintroduction projects.",['EN']

„Bürger:innen in Österreich erforschen ihre Dialekte“ ist ein sogenanntes „Bürgerwissenschaften“-Projekt. Uns geht es um die Dialekte in Österreich, also die Muttersprachen der meisten Österreicher:innen. Wenn Du aus Österreich bist – egal wie alt Du bist oder woher aus Österreich Du kommst –, lade Dir die App herunter und mach mit! Denn als Österreicher:in bist du automatisch Dialektexperte bzw. -expertin: Du kennst Dich damit am besten aus, wenn Du von klein auf Dialekt gesprochen hast oder zumindest andere in Deinem Umfeld Dialekt sprechen gehört hast. Deshalb weißt Du, welche Wörter verwendet werden, wie sie ausgesprochen werden und welche grammatischen Besonderheiten vorkommen. Bestimmt kennst Du auch andere, die noch den ‚ganz alten‘ Dialekt sprechen. Und womöglich sprichst Du nicht nur selbst Dialekt, sondern interessierst Dich auch für die Besonderheiten anderer Dialekte und die Unterschiede zwischen den Dialekten in Österreich. Hier kommt unser Projekt ins Spiel: Mit dieser App wollen wir Interessierte wie Dich selbst zu Forscher:innen machen. Wir geben Dir damit – buchstäblich – ein ,Werkzeug‘ an die Hand, damit Du die Besonderheiten Deines Dialekts und der Dialekte in Deiner Umgebung erforschen und mit anderen vergleichen kannst. Die dabei gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Daten verwenden wir etwa für die Erstellung von Sprachkarten, die Dir wiederum frei zugänglich zur Verfügung gestellt werden. 

**Wie soll’s gehen? … mit der OeDA-App!**
Das genannte ,Werkzeug‘ besteht aus der eigens für das Projekt entwickelten App mit dem Namen OeDA. OeDA ist eine Abkürzung für ‚Österreichische Dialekt-App‘ und soll an den Ausdruck Oida! erinnern, den in Österreich jede:r kennt, aber vielleicht unterschiedlich benutzt. Die OeDA-App machen wir Dir kostenlos zugänglich! Mit ihr kannst Du auf verschiedene Arten Dialektwörter und  sätze sammeln, Sprachproben aufnehmen, und die gesammelten Wörter und Ausspracheformen kannst Du Dir dann auf Sprachkarten anzeigen lassen. Über diese Sprachkarten kannst Du dann Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zwischen Dialekten verschiedener Regionen ermitteln. Du kannst dort auch Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zwischen den Sprechweisen verschiedener Generationen vergleichen und erforschen. Unterschiede zwischen den Sprechweisen der Generationen können zum Beispiel auf einen Wandel der Dialekte hindeuten. Wandel kann sich aber auch darin zeigen, dass Dialektformen aus verschiedenen Regionen einander immer ähnlicher werden. 

**Was ist das Besondere am Projekt?**
Die OeDA-App ist die erste Dialekt-App ihrer Art in Österreich. Sie ist einfach und benutzerfreundlich gestaltet und richtet sich an Dich, wenn du Dich für die Dialekte in Österreich interessierst.

The project aims to improve the water quality of the lakes through integrated monitoring and raising the awareness of their frequenters.

KNOW YOUR LAKE - View the contents near your position on the interactive map and quickly and easily access the data collected by those who already take care of the lake and other users. You can also learn more about the lake environment and the organisms that inhabit it through a glossary. Receive important environmental alerts (bathing, weather alerts).

OBSERVE - Have you noticed anything strange, unusual or curious? Share it! Take a picture and add the information you think is important to identify what you observed. You will be able to indicate the presence of algae (phytoplankton), foams, oily stains, litters, odours, drains and aspects related to fauna. Improve your knowledge with each observation thanks to the supporting images and explanatory texts associated with each item.

MEASURE - Are you taking a boat trip or a canoe ride and want to help the environment? Some of the water parameters (Transparency, Temperature, pH) can be measured in a very short time and without the need for complicated tools or specific preparation. By taking measurements of some water parameters you can help to improve the monitoring by integrating the results coming from satellites and sensors.

REPORT - If you notice something serious you can send an official report to the authorities with the data of your observation. In this way you can help them to check the state of the lake by providing useful information to make a pre-assessment of the extent of the observed phenomena.

GO TO THE FIELD - Stay up to date on the initiatives planned in your area regarding the environmental issues of lake protection. You will be able to attend clean-up events, measurement campaigns, seminars, training courses and much more.

Spend a few minutes of your time on the health of the environment in which you live and help us to spread the application among your friends and family!

Furthermore, it will demonstrate how the data collected by the volunteers can be used in hydrological modelling and, therefore, improve the prediction of climate change impact on water resources in data-scarce regions. The project outputs can be used to guide the development of future participatory monitoring programs and stimulate upscaling of the approach to other regions to address the lack of hydro-climatic data for evidence-based decision making and sustainable water management.

Volunteers participate by reporting measurements from easy-to-use instruments at weather and water stations installed in the project areas in Ecuador, Honduras and Tanzania. These measurements include rainfall, air temperature and humidity, as well as the water level and turbidity of rivers and streams. To evaluate the quality of the data, the data will be compared with automated reference measurements at selected sites. These are then systematically examined and tested for their suitability for modeling. This app enables easy submission of data by the volunteers and provides instructions on how to collect data. Furthermore, users can view the data previously submitted by other volunteers.

NoixApp,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noixapp/id1560868428?uo=4,ISTITUTO NAZIONALE DI OCEANOGRAFIA E DI GEOFISICA SPERIMENTALE - OGS,0.0,USD,"Among the many forms of pollution in urban areas, acoustic pollution is one of the less considered, albeit very important for the public health and welfare. Being less popular it is also less known and accounted for, so that few initiatives exist in this field. These are generally based on systematic surveying practices based on fixed stations only which cannot reconstruct a full picture of the acoustic spaces of the cities. A new perspective is necessary. Noixapp is a crowdsourcing/citizen-science solution developed by the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS, to measure acoustic pollution in urban areas that uses inexpensive mobile phone microphones to acquire data on urban background noise and send it to an integration platform that allows to reconstruct a full picture of the acoustic space of an area. The solution is based on a mobile application software where it is possible to record, compute and average Sound Pressure Level values. Georeferenced data are transmitted to OGS facilities where they are anonymized, integrated, validated and mapped on an open-data web based portal. SPL can be calibrated by using external reference instruments.",['EN']

Brukar du leta vårtecken och spana efter flyttfåglarna när de kommer på våren? Då är du välkommen att delta i Fågelkalendern! Med denna app kan du rapportera in dina observationer direkt till Artportalen och projektet Fågelkalendern.

För att kunna använda appen måste du vara registrerad fenologiväktare för Fågelkalendern samt ha ett konto på Artportalen. Du kan läsa mer och anmäla ditt intresse att delta i Naturens kalender.

I Fågelkalendern samlar vi in observationer av fåglar på ett organiserat sätt med målsättningen att kunna beskriva fåglarnas årstidsskiftningar i hela Sverige. Du kan hjälpa till genom att göra sådana observationer i dina hemtrakter!

För att delta i Fågelkalendern ska du göra dina observationer med samma metod som alla andra som är fenologiväktare för Fågelkalendern. Metodbeskrivningen får du när du anmäler ditt intresse att bli fågelfenologiväktare på Naturens kalender. I korthet handlar det om att du

·       väljer en plats där du ska göra återkommande observationer,
·       väljer en egen artlista med de fågelarter du kan identifiera och vill fokusera på och som är relevant för din observationsplats,
·       gör dina observationer under 5 minuter, 2 gånger per vecka,
·       observerar antalet sedda eller hörda individer av alla arter på din artlista,
·       även gör så kallade noll-observationer – d.v.s. arter på din artlista du inte sett/hört registreras som ”Ej återfunnen” i Artportalen, vilka är lika viktiga att rapportera in som de du sett/hört.

Om du är intresserad är du också välkommen att vara fenologiväktare för Växtkalendern och Bikalendern. Läs mer på www.naturenskalender.se.","['EN', 'SV']"

This NovelEco app incorporates a publicly accessible interactive Internet-based interface for input, feedback, communication, and management with volunteered geographic information (VGI). It serves as an information data gathering hub for the project team and gathers ecological and social data by the Citizen Scientists and over time will enable social network analysis.
NovelEco enables users to record and upload ecological data in urban wild spaces in a user-friendly, accessible, and functional manner. 

• NovelEco’s purpose is to gather crowdsourced ecological data in urban novel ecosystems, mainly using plants that can be found growing in unexpected places and abandoned or overlooked spaces. 
• It supports collaborative networking among citizen scientists and enables the gathering of social science data relating to attitudes to novel ecosystems and rewilding in an urban context. 
• It will ultimately become a repository of flora data in urban habitats that will be publically available to all citizens, as well as data on social values and perceptions that will be held privately.
• All of the social data is restricted to comply with GDPR.

Lovec Obojživelníků a Plazů CZ,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lovec-oboj%C5%BEiveln%C3%ADk%C5%AF-a-plaz%C5%AF-cz/id1557433135?uo=4,Ostravská univerzita,0.0,USD,"The Herpeto-Hunter CZ application was created with the support by Student Grant Competition of University of Ostrava. It is a product of collective work of the Department of Biology and Ecology, the Institute for Research and Applications of Fuzzy Modeling and the Department of Informatics and Computers with the participation of Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech republic.

The idea to create an application for the recognition of amphibians and reptiles was based on ongoing efforts of the entire team to create additional mobile applications that would enable users to recognize other groups of Czech animals in a simplified version.

This project was developed in the last year mainly thanks to the above mentioned cooperation with other experts not only in biology, but also in mathematics and computer science, such as Stanislav Ožana, Lukáš Choleva, Michaela Drgová, Marek Malina, Martin Prašek, Michal Burda and Veronika Zavadilová.

Together, we managed to create an application for basic identification and mapping of amphibians and reptiles, which main purpose is not only to identify and popularize these groups of vertebrates and nature as a whole among the general public, but also to involve the public in collecting data on species occurrence, which is called the citizen science.

We believe that the collected data obtained in this application will lead to a higher awareness of the occurrence of individual species and the protection of endangered species and their habitats.

The information used in the application was taken from:

Einmal Frühling mitten im Winter, dann wieder Kälteeinbrüche bis in den Mai. Für die Natur- und Klimaforschung wird es dabei immer wichtiger zu wissen, wann die Pflanzen zu blühen beginnen, fruchten oder das Laub abwerfen und die Tiere aktiv sind. Mit der App kannst du Tiere und Pflanzen fotografieren, eintragen was sie gerade machen und mit deinen Beobachtungen der Wissenschaft helfen. 

Jeder deiner Spots, jede Beobachtung und jedes Foto bringt einen wertvollen Beitrag für die Natur- und Klimaforschung in Oberösterreich, in Österreich und der ganzen Welt. Denn deine Beobachtungen fließen in die europäische phänologische Datenbank ein, die von der Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik betreut wird. Damit werden sie für KlimaforscherInnen auf der ganzen Welt nutzbar. 

Mit jedem Spot unterstützt du auch die Naturparkschulen Oberösterreichs, die im Projekt „Naturkalender Naturparke Oberösterreich“ an eigens gepflanzten Hecken ganz genau auf die Naturentwicklung Oberösterreichs schauen. Mehr zum Projekt und alle Beobachtungen gibt´s auf www.naturkalender-oberoesterreich.at.

EBW App,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ebw-app/id1620940741?uo=4,SPOTTERON Gmbh,0.0,USD,"Üblicherweise werden im Vertragsnaturschutz auf wertvollen Flächen konkrete Maßnahmen oder Verzichte vereinbart – z.B. keine Düngung oder ein später Mahdzeitpunkt. In der „Ergebnisorientierten Bewirtschaftung“ (EBW) werden statt Maßnahmen konkrete Ziele und Indikatoren auf der Fläche vereinbart. Die Maßnahmen zur Erreichung der Ziele werden Jahr für Jahr vom Landwirt oder der Landwirtin selbst entschieden.
Die Ziele auf der EBW Fläche sind sehr schlicht, aber dennoch konkret gehalten und geben die wesentliche Richtung an, wie mit dem Bestand der Fläche umgegangen werden soll. Sie orientieren sich am Lebensraumtyp der Fläche und am Zustand des Lebensraums. So kann ein Ziel z.B. heißen „Erhaltung der Magerwiese“, wenn der Zustand dieser Wiese gut ist. Im Falle eines nicht optimalen Zustands (z.B. Eindringen von Gehölzen oder Neophyten) kann das Ziel auch „Entwicklung einer Magerwiese“ lauten.
Die Indikatoren sind sehr wichtig. Sie zeigen den Zustand der Fläche an. Die in der Maßnahme EBW verfügbaren Indikatoren sind pro Lebensraum so ausgewählt worden, dass der Zusammenhang mit der Bewirtschaftung der Fläche sehr hoch ist. Indikatoren können sowohl das Vorhandensein von Arten oder Strukturen (z.B. Wiesen-Salbei) beschreiben als auch das Nicht-Vorhandensein von Arten oder Strukturen (z.B. Problempflanzen). Indikatoren müssen laufend vom Landwirt überprüft werden. Im Falle einer Vor-Ort-Kontrolle werden sie von der AMA kontrolliert.
Damit dieses neue System gut funktioniert, erhalten die Betriebe zu Beginn eine umfassende Beratung durch eine Ökologin oder einen Ökologen. Die relevanten Flächen werden alle gemeinsam begangen. Nach der Betriebsbegehung erhält der Bauer oder die Bäuerin eine Projektbestätigung, in der für alle vereinbarten Flächen Ziele und Indikatoren angegeben sind. Der Bauer oder die Bäuerin dokumentiert dann in dieser App, was sich auf der Fläche tut und wie sich die Indikatoren entwickeln.

To engage the global population more, this app was developed using SPOTTERON. The aim is to find out how the climate crisis is perceived by the population and which positive and negative emotions are associated with certain topics related to biodiversity and climate crisis.

The users should learn more about the climate crisis and, at the same time, be able to make a small contribution to climate protection. With the app, we want to bring people closer to the climate crisis in everyday life in order to emphasize certain factors more consciously. At the same time, the app is intended to integrate everyone with the help of the Citizen Science project (SPOTTERON) by allowing the user to document what he/she notices about the climate crisis in the most accessible way possible. It is important that not only the negative aspects are noted but that positive events also flow into the project. With this app, you can upload material on the topics of ""nature"", ""green energy"", ""public transport"" and ""other positive influences"", among other things. The negative aspects are addressed with the topics of ""construction,"" ""road traffic,"" ""environmental destruction,"" and ""other negative influences."" Then, on a scale of 1 to 5, the extent to which this has an impact on the climate crisis should be assessed.

This data is used anonymously by a wide variety of scientists to better understand the climate crisis and the associated changes. The users should learn more about the climate crisis and, at the same time, be able to make a small contribution to climate protection.","['EN', 'DE']"
