Being the interface between ministries for environmental issues, national and local political decision makers and the citizens, their experience evidences that the provision of data and information on air pollution to citizens in top-down and passive ways, as it happens today, is not sufficient to engage a critical mass of participating citizens required to support transitions in the systems of production and consumption that are the root cause of air pollution. CAPTOR combines the concepts of citizen science, collaborative learning and environmental grassroots activism to leverage the collective intelligence of existing networks of local communities, allowing them to understand reasons and consequences of air pollution; to stimulate debate; to address authorities with scientific valuable, robust data from citizens’ network of monitoring stations; and to transform this discussion into solutions. It runs three big pilots in Austria, Italy and Spain, driven by grassroots activists and local communities where citizens will engage in the project on different levels to address their concerns. The consortium includes a balanced group of multidisciplinary partners, including: institutions with recognised experience in ICT technologies, and in environmental and social sciences; one of the largest community networks in the world; and 3 NGOs with experience in grass root environmental activism and a strong links in the territory. The project has a large impact capacity, as it is reflected by the fact that more than 82 stakeholders from 21 European countries have already shown interest in the proposal results.",  Citizen Science  Air pollution,H2020-EU.2.1.1. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)                     Main Programme,ICT-10-2015 - Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation,UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA,"281062,50",CALLE JORDI GIRONA 31 08034 Barcelona Spain    ,http://www.upc.edu,11,11,UNIVERSITE CLERMONT AUVERGNE   France,49 BD FRANCOIS MITTERRAND 63000 Clermont Ferrand    ,"209742,00","209742,00",

A widely adopted, scientific way to assess the environmental status of water bodies is by measuring their optical properties (as indicators of, e.g. sewage impact, dissolved organic matter, sediment load or gross biological activity). The Citclops project aims to develop systems to retrieve and use data on seawater colour, transparency and fluorescence, using low-cost sensors combined with contextual information (e.g. georeferencing) and a community-based Internet platform, taking into account existing experiences (e.g. Secchi Dip-In, Coastwatch Europe and Oil Reporter). Simple and fast methods to establish the optical properties of seawater will be developed and used: e.g. the colour through Forel-Ule observations, and transparency through a variant of the Secchi disc. People will be able to acquire data taking photographs of the sea surface on ferries or other vessels, at the open sea or from the beach. Wearable digital cameras for aquatic activities with extended sensing systems are also proposed as alternative resources for crowdsourcing data. Data are automatically uploaded through a specific service or application (such as Google+ Instant Upload), archived remotely and processed, and resulting information is accessed through a webpage or a mobile application by end users. These are: policy makers (e.g. local administrations), which will be able to use the information to improve the management of the coastal zone; and citizens, who will be able to maximize their experience in activities in which water quality has a role.","Programme(s)  FP7-ENVIRONMENT - Specific Programme ""Cooperation"": Environment (including Climate Change)","FP7-ENVIRONMENT - Specific Programme ""Cooperation"": Environment (including Climate Change)",ENV.2012.6.5-1 - Developing community-based environmental monitoring and information systems using innovative and novel earth observation applications,FUNDACIO EURECAT,"468800,00",AVENIDA UNIVERSITAT AUTONOMA 23 08290 Cerdanyola Del Valles (Barcelona) Spain    ,http://www.eurecat.org/,11,11,STICHTING DELTARES   Netherlands,BOUSSINESQWEG 1 2629 HV Delft    ,"172250,00",No data,

Frequent exposure to odour is associated with headache, stress and respiratory problems. Odour nuisance is an indicator of larger environmental issues, such as poor waste management or polluted water. Yet, odour pollution has repeatedly been ignored in environmental regulations leaving citizens defenceless. Due to the lack of regulation, situated technical studies are rarely conducted and data and statistics on odour pollution are scarce or difficult to access. D-NOSES aims to provide a solution to this largely neglected problem by reversing the way in which odour pollution is commonly tackled. Our approach is to empower citizens with RRI, citizen science and co-creation tools to become drivers of change. D-NOSES promotes a quadruple helix model that will be applied at local, national and global levels. Through the International Odour Observatory, we will guarantee access to information in odour pollution. We will co-design citizen science interventions across 7 European and 3 non-European countries, where citizens will use innovative mapping tools to crowdsource odour issues and co-create ad-hoc solutions with CSOs, NGOs, local public authorities, odour emitting industries and academia. Advocacy actions, together with project results, such as DIY Guidelines for project replicability, scientific guidelines for policy making and The Green Paper on Odour Pollution, will be used as policy tools with the ultimate aim of introducing odour pollution in the policy agenda. A ‘Strategic Roadmap on Odour Pollution’ will pave the way for bottom-up, multi-level governance for increased sustainability in the medium to long term. To address D-NOSES aims we have assembled a world-class partnership combining experts in RRI, citizen science and co-creation, International Associations, odour scientists, including universities and SMEs, local administration and public bodies from 9 countries.","Programme(s)  H2020-EU.5.f. - Develop the governance for the advancement of responsible research and innovation by all stakeholders, which is sensitive to society needs and demands and promote an ethics framework for research and innovation Main Programme","H2020-EU.5.f. - Develop the governance for the advancement of responsible research and innovation by all stakeholders, which is sensitive to society needs and demands and promote an ethics framework for research and innovation                     Main Programme","SwafS-23-2017 - Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in support of sustainability and governance, taking account of the international context",FUNDACION IBERCIVIS,"659246,88",CALLE MARIANO ESQUILLOR SN CAMPUS RIO EBRO EDIFICIO I+D BLOQUE 2 PLANTA 2 50018 Zaragoza Spain    ,,15,15,INTERNATIONAL SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION   Netherlands,"STATIONSPLEIN 45, A4.004 3013 AK Rotterdam    ","138160,40","138160,40",

In particular, DIONE will:(i) Capitalise on recent results of ESA’s SEN4CAP project that showcased the capability of Sentineldata to monitor the crop diversification rules. DIONE shall further integrate generated crop-type maps in a way directly exploitable by the paying agencies;(ii) Include in the analysis the so far neglected EFA types (fallow land of all sizes, buffer strips, hedges, trees), by making use of super-resolution technology that improves the 10-20m Sentinel resolution to an improved resolution range (5-10m). This is enabled through Machine-Learning (ML) based post-processing and data fusion of Copernicus DIAS-sourced data with targeted drone-obtained data. This aims to motivate the use of such EFAs over the –of ambiguous environmental impact- use of productive areas (nitrogen-fixing crops and catch crops). (iii) Complement the use of EO data with a system of reliable, ground-based geo-tagged photos, captured by the farmers that exploits (a) advances that allow for improved positional accuracy, (ii) low-footprint encryption techniques for improved data security and reliability and (iii) image detecting manipulation techniques (image forensics). The system will allow for an improved LC/LU annotation and ensure the process is untampered.(iv) Implement a Green Compliance toolbox, integrated with the paying agencies’ aforementioned tools. This will benefit from (a) low-cost spectral sensors measuring soil quality and assessing the status of land-degradation in the land parcels and (b) an ML-based inferencing system deployed on a larger scale (regional, national) to quantify the levels of some of the monitored parameters and consequently extract tangible environmental performance metrics for an entire region","Fields of science (EuroSciVoc)  CORDIS classifies projects with EuroSciVoc, a multilingual taxonomy of fields of science, through a semi-automatic process based on NLP techniques.

The scientific contribution to these citizen-based activities will deliver the following outcomes: 1) Advanced ecological understanding of the drivers of biodiversity change in agricultural landscapes; 2) a selection of best-practice biodiversity-sensitive management by farmers based on their local requirement; 3) validated methods for biodiversity targeting, monitoring and evaluation and 4) private and public incentives to foster biodiversity-sensitive farming as a public good. Furthermore, FRAMEwork will assess the effectiveness of the Farmer Cluster approach to develop and implement place and system-specific biodiversity-sensitive farming practices and evaluate the economic and environmental performance, delivering a permanent on-line evaluation tool on the Citizen Observatory and Information Hub. The TRL of the Decision Support Tools ranges from 3-5, where improvements are foreseen for the TRL5 Decision Support Tool, while the ones at TRL3 will be brought to TRL4-5 through testing and improvements in the Farmers Clusters.

The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a long-standing challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop ‘campaigns’ (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives.

The hackAIR platform will enable the collection of data from: • measurements from existing air quality stations and open data• user-generated sky-depicting images (either publicly available geo-tagged and time-stamped images posted through social media platforms, or images captured by users• low-cost open hardware devices easily assembled by citizens using commercial off-the-shelf partsA data fusion algorithm and reasoning services will be developed for synthesising heterogeneous air quality data into air quality-aware personalised services to citizens.The hackAIR platform will be co-created with the users, and offered through:• a web application that communities of citizens will be able to install and customize• a mobile app that citizens can use to get convenient access to easy-to-understand air quality information, contribute to measurements by an open sensor, or by taking and uploading sky-depicting photos, and receive personalised air quality-aware information on their everyday activitiesThe hackAIR platform will be tested in two pilot locations, with the direct participation of a grassroots NGO with >400.000 members and a health association with >19.000 members.

By collectively measuring and making sense of changes in environmental phenomena citizens can become aware of how their lifestyle affects the ecosystem and be inspired to adopt more sustainable behaviours at the individual and community levels.Making Sense will show how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be effectively used by local communities to appropriate their own technological sensing tools, make sense of their environments and address pressing environmental problems in air, water, soil and sound pollution. To achieve this, the project will develop a Making Sense Toolkit based on theSmart Citizen platform for bottom up citizen science, developed at Fab Lab Barcelona. The toolkit will be tested in pilots in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Prishtina, aimed at deepening our understanding on the processes enabling collective awareness. Based on the pilots, we will develop a conceptual and methodological framework for participatory environmental maker practices. It will show how to provide citizens and communities with appropriate tools to enhance their everyday environmental awareness, to enable active intervention in their surroundings, and to change their individual and collective practices. And finally we will develop will develop a scientifically informed framework for citizen co-inquiry and action towards hands-on transformation of their surroundings.",Programme(s)  H2020-EU.2.1.1. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Main Programme,H2020-EU.2.1.1. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)                     Main Programme,ICT-10-2015 - Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation,STICHTING WAAG SOCIETY,"368612,50",NIEUWMARKT 4 1012 CR Amsterdam Netherlands    ,https://www.waag.org,5,5,UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE   Netherlands,DRIENERLOLAAN 5 7522 NB Enschede    ,"14687,50","14687,50",http://www.utwente.nl
