WaterLinx | Citizen Science,SPOTTERON Gmbh,"Water constitutes and connects all life forms on earth. However, current human water- and land-use patterns and emissions from our socio-industrial and consumption practices undermine the capacity of natural ecosystems in water and on land to regenerate themselves to remain a healthy basis for diverse forms of life. The health of interconnected water and soil systems is deteriorating at an ever-faster pace. Potential impacts from climate change threaten to accelerate this decline Just reducing our harmful impacts will no longer suffice. We need to take regenerative action. Restoring healthy water bodies is also a fundamental need to make the planet’s life support system with water and earth more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change.  But where should we act first, and what actions promise success?  EU Data sets relating to water quality are expensive to obtain and accordingly scantly distributed across time and space. Most data related to large rivers but not smaller streams that may flow through biodiversity-rich areas. 



Citizen science can play an important role in complementing official data sets on water quality to identify pollution hot spots, in particular in small streams that are not usually monitored by experts (König et al., 2020).  This APP provides a citizen science tool to explore water quality and ecosystem health where you stand and can take action.  Data collected with this APP can 
- inform you and any citizen in an accessible manner on where regenerative action for healthy water bodies might be most urgently needed, 
- open new windows on compliance with EU water quality standards and on the effectiveness of Luxembourg policy making and implementation, 
- be used by scientists (experts and citizens) to evaluate and learn from regenerative projects.

Echo Meter Touch Bat Detector,Wildlife Acoustics,"Using the Echo Meter Touch 2 Pro plug-in module, this app allows you to listen to record and automatically identify bats by their ultrasonic echolocation calls. The module and this companion app reveal the silent and often times invisible world of bats, providing outdoor enthusiasts, citizen scientists, and researchers an affordable and informative way to interact with these important creatures. There are two models: Echo Meter Touch 2 (EMT 2) is intended for nature enthusiasts and batting hobbyists and Echo Meter Touch 2 Pro is designed for bat professionals and features a higher quality microphone, adjustable gain, and higher sample rate.

The Echo Meter Touch Ultrasonic Module senses ultrasonic signals, digitizes the signal, and transmits the ultrasonic data to the app on your iOS device. 

LISTEN TO BAT’S ECHOLOCATIONS
EMT2 translates bat echolocations into frequencies that are audible to humans using two technologies. Wildlife Acoustics’ patented Real Time Expansion (RTE) allows you to listen to bats in real time with unparalleled fidelity. RTE maintains the timing and tonality of the original echolocations. Heterodyne (HET) listening via manual and automatic tuning is also available, for those accustomed to that way of hearing bats. 

VIEW THE ECHOLOCATIONS ON A SPECTROGRAM
A real-time spectrogram shows the frequencies and timing of the echolocations. Scroll back in time and zoom in on previous ""bat passes.""  

SEE MOST LIKELY BAT SPECIES IN REAL-TIME***
The Auto ID feature analyzes the echolocation calls and suggests the two most likely bat species matches in real time. This is the same technology used in our professional Kaleidoscope Pro Bat Auto Identification software. Currently, the app can identify 26 species in North America, 25 in Europe and 57 in the neotropics. For more information on Kaleidoscope and a full list of species, visit our website.

RECORD .WAV FILES
Activate triggered recording mode to automatically save bat passes to full spectrum .wav files for analysis on a computer or to view on your iDevice. Or use manual record mode to control start and stop of recording. View the recording spectrogram and add voice or text notes. Listen to the recording using RTE, HET, or traditional Time Expansion Playback (playback at fractional speed to make the ultrasound audible).

SEE YOUR PATH AND RECORDING LOCATIONS
View in satellite or road map view. View identified species codes directly on the map. Go to the recording's spectrogram from the map view. Transfer to your computer to view in Google Earth. Your iDevice must have GPS capability or you must use a Bluetooth GPS receiver for this functionality.
*Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*

TRANSFER RECORDINGS TO YOUR COMPUTER 
The EMT 2 can transfer the .wav recordings to your computer over a Wi-Fi network or using a USB cable. 

SHARE RECORDINGS VIA EMAIL OR MMS MESSAGING 
And import and open files that have been shared with you.

***Because bats vary their echolocation calls in response to a wide variety of needs, no automated identification can achieve 100% accuracy in species identification. Auto-ID, though largely accurate, should not be relied on as a basis for scientific research. Auto-ID is intended for use in analyzing recordings of single bats in free flight in low clutter environments. Auto-ID will not work well on recordings of roost emergence, multiple or captive bats, bats in high clutter environments, or bat social calls. Auto-ID does not include every possible bat for each of the covered regions.",https://apps.apple.com/us/app/echo-meter-touch-bat-detector/id693958125?uo=4,['EN'],https://www.echometertouch.com

AmphiApp | Citizen Science,SPOTTERON Gmbh,"Amphibien gehören zu den am stärksten bedrohten Tiergruppen Österreichs und auch weltweit. Die Gründe dafür umfassen unter anderem die Zerstörung und Degradierung von Lebensräumen, diverse Pilzkrankheiten sowie Veränderungen in der Landnutzung. Für einige Amphibienarten gehören, trotz vieler Störungen, auch landwirtschaftliche Gebiete oder gar Städte zu wichtigen Lebensräumen. Unsere Zielart ist die bedrohte Wechselkröte - eine typische Pionierart, die neu entstehende Gewässer schnell besiedeln kann. In Österreich liegt ihr Hauptverbreitungsgebiet in Ostösterreich mit vereinzelten inselartigen Vorkommen im Westen. Ihre natürlichen Laichgewässer sind nach Regenfällen gefüllte Steppenseen oder nach Überschwemmungen entstandene Tümpel mit starker Sonneneinstrahlung. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen, sind die natürlichen Laich-Habitate der Wechselkröte in Europa weitgehend verschwunden. Neben diesen naturnahen Gewässern werden heute oft künstliche Gewässer oder Lacken, die nach Regengüssen gefüllt sind, von Wechselkröten angenommen. Das Verschwinden von Brachflächen und Verschließen von Baulücken führt jedoch sowohl im ländlichen als auch im innerstädtischen Gebiet zu einer Verschlechterung des Erhaltungszustandes der Wechselkröte. Gegenmaßnahmen, wie beispielsweise die Bereitstellung von Ersatzlebensräumen, wirken dieser negativen Entwicklung entgegen.

Projektziele von AmphiBiom
Ein wichtiger Schritt für ein umfassendes Schutzkonzept für die Wechselkröte erfordert eine österreichweite Bestandsaufnahme und Analyse ihrer Habitat-Präferenzen unter Einbeziehung von Schadstoffen in den Gewässern und der Landnutzung. Das vorliegende Projekt nutzt Citizen Science zur Untersuchung dieser Pionierart, um die Verbreitung in Arealen, die oftmals für die Forschung unzugänglich sind (z.B. Privatgärten), zu untersuchen und Bürger*innen aktiv in das Projekt einzubinden. Darüber hinaus ist es ein Ziel den Teilnehmenden zu zeigen, dass sie selbst durch nur wenig Aufwand (z.B. durch die Anlage von Kleingewässern) das Überleben dieser geschützten Art fördern können. Diese Lebensraumschaffung wird den Erhaltungszustand der Wechselkröten und anderer bedrohter Amphibien-Pionierarten erheblich verbessern. Wir erwarten zudem eine große Vielfalt wirbelloser Tiere (z.B. Insekten), die zu einer Zunahme der Biodiversität in ganz Österreich beitragen wird. Unsere Analysen werden uns ermöglichen, klare Handlungsweisen zum Schutz dieser seltenen Biotope zu geben. Die Involvierung von Bürger*innen ermöglicht hier die breite Ausrollung unserer Initiative, erhöht die Nachhaltigkeit der Aktion und schafft ein Problembewusstsein für Biodiversitätsschutz in Österreich. 

Wie können Sie mitmachen?
Bevor Sie mittels App aktiv teilnehmen können, müssen Sie sich registrieren oder einloggen. Für die Teilnahme am Projekt AmphiBiom bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten. Haben Sie auf einem abendlichen Spaziergang eine Wechselkröte, oder ein anderes Amphib, gehört, dann können Sie den Ruf direkt in der App aufzeichnen und melden. Sie haben auch die Möglichkeit sich aktiv in der Laichgewässerschaffung für Wechselkröten zu engagieren. Hierfür steht ein eigenes Online-Formular über www.amphi.at zur Verfügung.

About the Sightings Network

The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a research and conservation program of the Vancouver Aquarium in collaboration with the Cetacean Research Program of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

The Sightings Network is a network of thousands of observers across British Columbia who report their sightings of whales, dolphins, porpoises and sea turtles. Anyone can be an observer and every report improves our understanding of the distribution and occurrence of cetaceans and sea turtles in B.C. waters.

There are 12 species or populations of cetaceans and sea turtles native to British Columbia listed under the Species at Risk Act. These species face many threats from human activity such as entanglement in fishing gear, disturbance by vessels, and accumulation of pollutants.

Learn more about cetaceans, sea turtles and their conservation at www.wildwhales.org.

How Sightings Network Data is Used

The data collected are used in conservation and research-based projects to better understand and protect cetacean and sea turtles in B.C. waters. Sightings are not made available to the public so as to avoid advertising cetacean and sea turtles hot spots, and contributing to vessel disturbance to cetaceans and sea turtles in these areas. Data can be requested for use in academic research, conservation assessment and planning, species recovery planning including critical habitat determination, and environmental impact assessment, evaluation and mitigation.

myHAZ-VCT,British Geological Survey,"myHAZ-VCT is a citizen science app for sharing your observations of natural hazards and environmental phenomena in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A collaboration between The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (SRC) in Trinidad and Tobago, the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the British Geological Survey (BGS), myHAZ-VCT is designed to provide scientists (SRC), emergency managers (NEMO) and citizens of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with first-hand information about a range of natural hazards and environmental phenomena that occur in the country.

Through the myHAZ-VCT app you can upload photos, videos and free-text descriptions on a range of natural hazards including flooding, storms, landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis and other environmental phenomena such as drought, ground subsidence and changes in water levels. In addition, there are more detailed, optional questions to answer to help scientists, emergency managers and your fellow citizens know what is going on across St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 

When a new observation is submitted, it is initially reviewed by myHAZ-VCT managers at SRC and NEMO, and then published in the app for other myHAZ-VCT users to view. A commenting facility within myHAZ-VCT lets users, SRC scientists and NEMO staff respond to observations, whilst SRC and NEMO can also send direct notifications to myHAZ-VCT users, such as further information and advice about ongoing hazards. 

myHAZ-VCT uses a citizen science approach for gathering valuable data on various natural hazards occurring in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Citizen science is the active involvement of the non-scientific public in scientific research.  Since scientists and emergency managers cannot be everywhere, enlisting members of the public like you, in sharing observations on multihazards can provide a broader understanding of the impact and behaviour of these in your community.  This information can be used by NEMO to respond more effectively to impacted communities as well as to develop robust hazard mitigation systems.",https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myhaz-vct/id1507981214?uo=4,['EN'],https://uwiseismic.com/myhaz-vct/
EyeOnWater - Colour,MARIS B.V.,"The EyeOnWater concept consists of an App and a website. The app allows you as user to make a contribution to science and supply information about the water colour of fresh- as well as saline waters (lakes, rivers, coastal waters, seas and oceans) near your location or elsewhere. The measurement is sent to the central server, validated and stored, after which it is visible via the EyeOnWater website: www.eyeonwater.org 

What is it you measure? Water colour is an indication for life (e.g. algae) in the water. Scientists have been measuring this in marine waters via the Forel-Ule scale for more than 200 years. Your measurements will contribute to this long term observation and continue the timeseries.

Tea Bag Index | SPOTTERON,SPOTTERON Gmbh,"The educational App Tea Bag Index (TBI) collects data on soil observations and on soil decomposition dynamics in particular. The decomposition of organic matter in the soil is part of the global carbon cycle that provide information on the biological activity of the soil and is therefore important for climate change. Changes in the carbon content of soil can both intensify and mitigate climate change. 

The citizen scientists may choose from 3 activities: 1) basic soil observations by recording soil colour, soil life and land use, 2) soil observations by studying soil texture by feel of doing the Spade test, 3) TBI. The TBI records the decomposition rates of buried tea bags (green tea and rooibos) within 3 months using a standardised method. The method can easily be performed by citizen scientists, such as students. The collected data is transmitted to the database of the Global Tea Bag Index Network (www.teatime4science.org). 

Schools can easily include the TBI App in their curriculum. Teaching materials (soil observation with all senses, spade test, soil texture by feel, TBI) in the App increase the students´ knowledge of soil and the global carbon cycling. 
Tea Bag Index App will further contribute to a strong connection between science and society by connecting each one of the activity categories to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

IPM Popillia Pest Management,SPOTTERON Gmbh,"IPM-Popillia aims to address the challenge of a new risk to plant health in Europe, the invasion of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica. This pest was introduced accidentally to mainland Europe in 2014 (EPPO 2014) and can easily spread in the course of trade and the movement of goods and people. P. japonica threatens the entire agricultural sector, urban landscapes, and biodiversity in invaded areas.

Prevention of the species’ invasion faces two constraints: The possibilities to restrict the movement of goods and people are limited, and successful eradication of the population established south of the Italian-Suisse border is impossible. With the IPM (Integrated Pest Management) Citizen Science App, the public can contribute sightings of the Japanese Beetle and participate in location monitoring. The App allows recording beetle sightings selection of damaged crops, fruits, vegetables, and other plant species. With your Citizen Science observations for agricultural fields or in your garden and private horticulture, you help the team of IPM Popillia to combat the invasive species and ensure food safety in agriculture in Europe, the US, and beyond.

Recently, EFSA and the JCR of the European commission have nominated P. japonica as a candidate high priority pest in the new EU Plant health Law. Against this background, it is paramount to develop measures that help to confine the spread of the new pest and prevent the build-up of high population densities that cause economic loss to agricultural crops and increase migration pressure of the Japanese beetles.

The project IPM-Popillia develops these measures. It involves teams working in the core of the recent outbreak area, conducting fit-for-purpose practical research in a European environment that can be applied immediately as short-term containment measures. In the longer term, IPM-Popillia provides tools and advice on managing the pest on a larger, European continental scale and how to be better prepared for similar pest invasions in the future.

Black hole finder,DDQ,"Welcome to the Black Hole Finder, an exciting citizen science project dedicated to discovering black holes, particularly those formed from the fusion of two neutron stars. You have the unique opportunity to contribute to this cutting-edge research from the comfort of your home, using your phone, tablet, or computer.

Our app brings the cosmos to your fingertips. When two neutron stars merge, they create a powerful event, sending gravitational waves through space. These events are detected by our gravitational wave detectors, which alert us to potential black hole formations. Mergers of this kind not only create black holes but also give birth to rare Earth elements such as Iodine, Gold, and Cerium. All these elements, especially Iodine, play crucial roles in supporting life as we know it.

In addition to gravitational waves, these cosmic collisions emit light signals. The chase is on to detect these signals with our trio of specially designed BlackGEM telescopes located in Chile. The catch is that the detectors only provide a general localization of the event and the light signals are fleeting. Therefore, we need to act quickly to capture these signals before they fade away after a few days or a week at most.

That's where you come in! Using our app, you will sift through real-time images of the sky taken by our BlackGEM telescopes. You will help us spot these light signals, effectively identifying potential new black holes. Not only will you be possibly among the first to set eyes on the light from these celestial events, but with some training, you may also direct telescopes to take additional measurements of intriguing objects.

Your contributions to science won't go unnoticed. Participants who make significant discoveries will be offered co-authorship on scientific publications that result from their findings. We also provide training and guidance to enrich your understanding of the cosmos.
